# 42PushSwap 

## About </br></br>
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting. </br></br>
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will
need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions to manipulate both stacks.</br></br>

Your goal ? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that
sorts the integer arguments received.</br></br>
I choose [Radix Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu4gDuFabIM) due its brilhant resolution and due to its complexity (O (n log(n)), same as QuickSort.)</br></br>
