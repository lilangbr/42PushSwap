# 42PushSwap  

## About
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting. </br></br>
The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will
need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of
instructions to manipulate both stacks.</br></br>

Your goal ? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that
sorts the integer arguments received.</br></br>
I choose [Radix Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu4gDuFabIM) due its brilhant resolution and due to its complexity (O (n log(n)), same as QuickSort, in the middle case. [see](https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/56836/defini%C3%A7%C3%A3o-da-nota%C3%A7%C3%A3o-big-o#:~:text=A%20ideia%20da%20nota%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Big,%2C%20genericamente%2C%20por%20n%20))</br></br>
Use like this:
```
$ make
$ ./push_swap {{int_numbers}}
$ (You can use an script to shuffle: ARG=$(ruby -e "puts (-50..49).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')") (To shuffle 100 numbers, for example)
$ ./push_swap $ARG
```
</br>

*Note: If you want to view the stacks, use the print_to_terminal.c function in the debbug folder. Just include the file name in the Makefile, the function definition in the .h file and use it inside the order_\* functions, at the end, before releasing the stacks, if any. (free_stack command)*. </br></br>
*Important: For testing, don't print the stack, just the commands. That is, don't use the print_to_terminal.c function (That's exactly why it wasn't included, but left as gift)*.
</br></br>

## Testing: </br>

### To test with checker:
```
$ ARG=$(ruby -e "puts (0..499).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')")
$ ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_linux $ARG
```
